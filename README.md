# Text-Character-Analyzer
extCharAnalyzer is a Python script that analyzes character frequencies in a text file (HadoopBlurb.txt). It counts alphabetic characters, splits them into three random dictionaries, merges the counts, and validates the results with a test. The script uses argparse for file input and outputs unique character counts and the most frequent character.
